# Objective

I developed a grading application in Java that allows users to input grades for their class and calculate their average grade.
The program prompts users to specify the Homework and Exam grades the program then collects the grades. Afterward, 
it computes the average weighted grade for their class and it determines if you passed the class with the final grade.
